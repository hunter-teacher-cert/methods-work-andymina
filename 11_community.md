# Community Building Techniques

## Target Environment: School

School Attributes:
* school size: average school size? ~20-30v students in club
* school grade range: 9-12 (meant for anyone who's taken a CS class or just wants to learn about CS)
* faculty count: ~2 full-time CS teachers
* courses: AP CS A, AP CS P, Design Drafting and Production, Computer Graphics
* * *

### How It Works

There will be two full-time CS teachers available for this after-school program. Both teachers will
float around the classroom helping or answering student questions when needed OR one teacher will hold a
small workshop to briefly introduce students to something new that relates to computers.

The Computer Corner doesn't focus only on programming but instead teaches/focuses on a broad range of computer
topics. This could include things like IT, networking and how the internet works, Computer Theory, AI/ML, 
digital editing, human-computer interactions, and even bioinformatics. The goal is to show students that there
is far more to computers than just programming.

Students are given the space to work on whatever relevant work they'd like. For some students, this may be
homework for a CS class, working on a personal project, or learning something new. While the teachers are there
the idea is for students to take the lead and for the Computer Corner to evolve into a modern School of Athens:
a place where peers teach each other new things and challenge existing ideas.

Finally, students will be given the opportunity to sign up and demonstrate their project or what they've learned
to the class. This effectively allows for student-run workshops as well.

#### Floating

On occasion, the teachers may float and answer student questions where necessary. However, teachers should
always direct students to ask another student first. The goal isn't for this to be a classroom but, instead a
large group-work setting.

#### Workshop

 If a sizeable number of students wish to learn or review a topic, one of the two teachers can hold a workshop.
 Workshops should be brief (no more than 30m) and activity-focused, using code alongs or internet research.
 Students can then work together in smaller groups to create something related to the workshop and expand their 
 skill set.


### Expected Positive Outcomes

Students will be given the space to work on something meaningful to them. I myself didn't have the time to do so
in school so any questions I had, I stumbled through on my own.

Students will also practice their collaborative working skills as some students may choose to work in a group on
a project together or answering other students' questions.

Given that students will be working on something, they are expanding their professional portfolio. If they choose
not to pursue CS in the future, they will be a well-rounded computer-literate professional in their field.

#### Rollout Timeline

* I would expect this to take around a month to catch on and get a decent number of students. I imagine more
  brief workshops would attract more students.
* Significant milestones:
  * the first workshop
  * the first time a student answers anothers' questiopn
  * the first project worked on
  * the first group project
  * the first demo

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy

Students will be required to sign-in every day. At the beginning of the week, students will have to fill out 
a brief entry ticket describing some loose, non-committal goals for the week. Conversely, at the end of the week,
students will have to fill out an exit ticket of what they actually did plus any workshops they might want to see
in the coming weeks.

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Getting the first group of students will be difficult since it's hard to get students to do something
  after school. However, since this is open to anyone who wants to explore, it should gain some traction
  after the first couple of showings.
