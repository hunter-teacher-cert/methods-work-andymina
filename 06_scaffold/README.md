# Scaffolding Write-up

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- use conditionals to control program flow
- use `do-while` loops to simulate the flow of a two-player game
- create and call functions to encapsulate code
- follow existing documentation and specifications to create a program

## Explanation

I imagined this assignment as an early-ish review of core programming concepts. At this
point in time, students should be familiar with creating and calling functions and comfortable
using loops and conditionals. Since students are only familiar with creating and calling functions,
I limited the number of functions for students to create. The only function to be created is one
that processes the CPU's turn so that students can practice this. I kept the remaining function
signatures so they can focus on getting more practice in with loops and conditionals. The function
that students create can be modeled after the existing `getPlayerMove` function give them some
scaffolding to write function signatures on their own.

I also included subgoal labeling. Since this is an early class, I don't want students to feel like
they've hit a wall and have no idea where to go. Using comments as guideposts, I can make sure
they have a general gameplan for implementation.

## Follow-up

In the future, I would probably delete any starter variables initialized in functions, like
`validMove` in the `getPlayerMove` function. This would push students to think more heavily about
how they might structure their code at the start so the end goal is easier to achieve.

I would also remove the subgoal labeling so that students can make the choices that seem best to
them and only leave function documentation about behavior.
