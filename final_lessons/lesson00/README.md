# Lesson 00 Reflection

This lesson should be delivered sometime during the later third of the AP CS A course. By that point,
students should be comfortable with the fundamentals of programming (loops, conditionals, functions)
and working with arrays.

## Methods Analysis

- CS unplugged
  - I chose this because it's best to model things in different formats for students.
- Scaffolding
  - Since this would ideally be one of the first lessons to sorting, which is a pretty dense
    topic, I scaffolded the code fairly heavily to get students to focus on the core content
- Code Along
  - As I mentioned in class, I was a Lead Instructor at a high school summer intensive and I found
    this medium of delivering content to be the best. It gets students to practice what we're 
    learning by writing code, and at the same time they're taking notes on the lesson. Code alongs
    also keep students more engaged than lectures.
