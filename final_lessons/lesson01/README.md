# Lesson 01 Reflection

This lesson should be delivered after Lesson 00, either directly or with a review session in
between. By that point, students should be comfortable with the idea of sorting algorithms 
and should understand that sorting can happen in many different ways.

## Methods Analysis

- CS unplugged
  - As mentioned in Lesson 00, I find it best to present content in different forms/mediums
    as it allows for more means of engagement for students.
- Pair programming
  - This was a new teaching method for me to use in my lesson plan. For this most part, I think
    it's fairly applicable here since the Starter code is so thoroughly scaffolded. Given more
    time, I would discourage students from running their code unless they're sure it would work.
    This would push them to talk things out in pairs and code trace.
